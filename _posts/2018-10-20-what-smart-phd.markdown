Recently, British philosopher Mary Midgley died. This afternoon I was thinking about her. 
And I was thinking about what she said [in the Guardian](https://www.theguardian.com/education/2005/oct/03/highereducation.uk2)
about how she never finished her PhD dissertation. She said, "I ended up unqualified -- and grateful for it."

Take someone who starts, but does not finish, a PhD. They enter grad school, with the same qualifications as the people who would later finish, but don't walk away with the degree for some reason or other. What qualities might a person who is equally intelligent (by the same standards: admission into the program) as someone who does finish the diss have? Then, on the other hand, what kinds of orientations would thrive during the PhD process and larger institutional hyper-structure, and perform well in how academia is done now?

And those people whose intelligence doesn't bode well with the PhD process: what's their deal? And where do those people go? 

I began thinking about my own experience with research and how it has shaped me. Would I say that I've gotten smarter? I also began thinking about how I might change and be altered if I continued to do this kind of work. 

In some ways, I'm smarter. I am definitely better now at doing what scholars do, and finding answers to questions the way scholars do. I know how I might go about using best academic practices to answer a question in a respectable, socially justifiable norms. I know better how I like to work work when doing that research, so I can manage my performance better. I'm also smarter by virtue of knowing more about the world: I know more facts, I know the language scholars use to express themselves, and more importantly at least, I know how a particular discourse has been hacking away at a topic. Just knowing about how long-standing and widespread ways of representing and inquiring on a phenomenon can help me frame future questions. Again, research experience has made me more efficacious at doing more research.






I think some really suspicious shit is going on with this 'competent speakers of a language'
shit in philosophy.
