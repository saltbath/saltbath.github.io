Recently, British philosopher Mary Midgley died. This afternoon I was thinking about her. 
And I was thinking about what she said [in the Guardian](https://www.theguardian.com/education/2005/oct/03/highereducation.uk2)
about how she never finished her PhD dissertation. She said, "I ended up unqualified -- and grateful for it."

I began thinking about my own experience with research and how it has shaped me. And as I begin projecting into the future, I wonder: if I continued to do this intensively, how will I change? Are there any cognitive costs that come with PhDification? Would I say that I've gotten smarter? 

How does a PhD change you? How does a PhD enhance intelligence, and what ways does it not? What kinds of intelligence are kept intact by not staying in the PhD process? 

In some ways, I can say, research has made me smarter. I am definitely better now at doing what scholars do, and finding answers to questions the way scholars do. I know how I might go about using best academic practices to answer a question in a respectable, socially justifiable norms. I know better how I like to work when doing that research, so I can manage my performance better. I'm also smarter by virtue of knowing more about the world: I know more facts, I know the language scholars use to express themselves, and more importantly at least, I know how a particular discourse has been hacking away at a topic. Just knowing about how long-standing and widespread ways of representing and inquiring on a phenomenon can help me frame future questions. Again, research experience has made me more efficacious at doing more research.

I think some really suspicious shit is going on with this 'competent speakers of a language' shit in philosophy.
