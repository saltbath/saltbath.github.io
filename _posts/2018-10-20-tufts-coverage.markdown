Just a while ago, the lovely Laura Ferguson from Tufts Now wrote a piece
on the research I did this summer.  Every year, Tufts sponsors a small cohort of
undergraduate researchers to conduct independent research with faculty mentorship,
and this summer, I was lucky enough to be delve into the what is the most fascinating line of inquiry:
the emerging medium of cinematic virtual reality, and the new aesthetic and cognitive experiences it affords.

[Jump here](https://web.archive.org/web/20181020174741/https://now.tufts.edu/articles/hands-research-undergraduates) to read about it, and
check out the projects of my amazing cohorts. They're bogglingly cool.

Pictured is my super talented friend Faizan, who is also working in
AR/VR applications.
