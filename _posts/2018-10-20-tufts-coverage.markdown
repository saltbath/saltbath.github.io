Every year, Tufts sponsors a small cohort of
undergraduates to conduct independent research with faculty mentorship, on a project of their choice.
This summer, I was lucky enough to get the chance to delve into what is most fascinating to me:
the emerging medium of cinematic virtual reality, and the new aesthetic and cognitive experiences it affords.

[Jump here](https://web.archive.org/web/20181020174741/https://now.tufts.edu/articles/hands-research-undergraduates) to read about it, and
check out the bogglingly cool projects of my amazing cohorts.

Pictured is my super talented friend Faizan, who is also working in
AR/VR applications.
