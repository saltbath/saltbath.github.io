The year is 2025.

DANIELLE JACKSON & PETER BELTRAN, 55, 39 respectively. Danielle, an attorney, hits it off with freelance writer Peter when they meet in a Zoom conference on prepping. Soon enough, they decide to move in together for quarantine in Danielle’s Midtown apartment. Believing bartering to be the new Bitcoin, they sneak around a New York City boarded-up under martial law, using Craigslist to find trading partners they can exchange legal advice and clickfarm content for groceries and supplies. 

LORI KANG, 51, Lori is the head engineer at Bioquest Labs in Kendall Square, innovating high-tech solutions for pandemic consumers. Here, she specializes in safeskins™, a luxury essential pandemic technology in the form of uber-comfortable gloves, designed to be kept on all the time (“they feel just like skin, guaranteed!”). Partnering with fashion house Bottega Veneta, Lori works to rush-produce a line of couture safeskins ™, “tailored for the modern, tactile womxn.” She considers this radical feminist praxis. 

SAM DONAGHUE, 25, worker in a safeskin™ manufacturing plant, newly opened in southern New Hampshire as a part of the New Americanism movement, a last-ditch effort to bring manufacturing back to the US and revitalize rural areas. Due to the sudden surge in safeskin demand, he is lucky to have landed a job in the plant. (He was fired from his last job at Target, as he got caught smuggling a prohibitively expensive can of Lysol home to his pregnant wife.) 

ZACHARY & ZOE CLARK, 9, 14, respectively. Since the school closures, Zachary and Zoe have been locked into their suburban Connecticut home. Zachary develops what pediatric psychologists are calling “generational agoraphobia,” increasingly anxious even to step out into his driveway in the morning, when all the neighborhood kids perform their synchronized pledge of allegiance. Meanwhile, Zoe develops class consciousness through TikTok.  

MASHA DELETOVNA, 31, podcastress. A member of the Femme Dirtbag Left and ABD, Masha is the star of hot new pod series Infoworst, a kind of anti-fash, pro-ana, pop-psychoanalytic Zizek Digest. Though her Patreon is thriving, she secretly wonders how long she can pretend to be friends with her downwardly mobile Patreon subscribers and read off promotions for BetterHelp subscriptions in vocal fry.  

CAITLYN BOER, 18, daughter of Val Boer, the Hot Pocket heiress who was recently charged for fraud in the latest college admissions scandal. Thanks to Val’s crime, Caitlyn matriculated at Reed last fall, only to now find herself the most commonly subtweeted person on her college’s Facebook meme page. Caitlyn won’t even speak to her mother, now in jail. As soon as Reed goes online, she flies home, and hides away to sip mojitos in the Boers’ new pandemic-proof, underground luxury bunker. 

LINDA LIU, 71, a San Francisco native and recent widow, not due to the virus itself, but a hate crime derivative of it. In the deadly, contagious racism spreading in her hometown, Linda realizes with renewed loneliness that SF was never her home, not really. During her quarantine, her sole connection to the outside world is her FaceTime sessions with her niece.  

MAX LOMBARDI, 29, Philly-based Twitter artist @RT_nnews. “Disinformation is my medium of choice,” he recently told NY Mag. “What is the architectural potential of fake news?” he asked an arts journalist in his best TED-talk voice. Emboldened by the blogosphere hailing him as “the centrists’ answer to Cernovich” and “a one-man Anonymous, but for blue-wave Twitter,” clout-hungry Lombardi grows increasingly bold in his online stunts for his fans. 

LARA BARR, member of Portland antifa, and drummer in the city’s hottest horror-metal band, Handless Pelosi. When the virus creates blockades in the city, Lara joins the
