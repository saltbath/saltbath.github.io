## hi,

i'm justine. i use this space to vent a mind. 

i'm a virtual reality researcher, particularly interested in interactive narrative VR experiences and affordances of 
fictional presence. my side job is in video production. whatever a futurist is, i am one.

i currently study philosophy (if you're curious, my emphasis is in meta-ethics and
philosophical methodology). i also have deep academic interests in
STS and Internet studies. 

i'm from seoul and LA, and now consider boston my home. i only wear analog watches, and 
i value playing truly without aim.
