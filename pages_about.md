## hi,

i'm justine. i use this space to vent a mind. i'm a virtual reality researcher, 
particularly interested in interactive narrative VR experiences and their ways of affording 
fictional presence. between you and me, i believe that cinematic virtual reality is the zenith of 
art, the natural form of art's culmination. my side job is in video production. 
whatever a futurist is, i consider myself one.

i currently study philosophy (if you're curious, my emphasis is in meta-ethics and
philosophical methodology). i also have deep academic interests in
STS and Internet studies. 

i'm from seoul and LA, but now consider boston my home. i only wear analog watches, and 
i value playing truly without aim.
