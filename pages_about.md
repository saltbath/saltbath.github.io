## hi.

i'm justine. i'm a virtual reality researcher, particularly interested in
interactive narrative VR experiences and their ways of affording fictional presence. between you
and me, i believe that cinematic virtual reality is the zenith of art, the natural form of its culmination. my side job is in video production. 

i currently study philosophy in boston (if you're curious, my emphasis is in meta-ethics and
philosophical methodology). i also have deep academic interests in
STS and Internet studies.

i'm seoul-born, LA-raised, and boston-based. i only wears analog watches, and 
i believe in playing, truly without aim.
